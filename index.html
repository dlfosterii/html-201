            Hi there!
            <p> I worked for 22 years at
                <a href="http://waltdisneyworld.com">"The Most Magical Place on Earth"</a>.</p>
              <p> I was a stage tech working with lighting, audio, & pyrotechnics.
                My last several years with Disney I was part of the training team for
                Entertainment Technicians maintaining and delivering all</p>
                <ul><li>pyro training</li>
                  <li>on the job training</li>
                  <li>vendor training</li></ul>
                <p>As a part of my role I often quiped: "If it blows up on property, and
                we meant for it to, I had something to do with it!" I was also the webmaster
                for out team's intranet site. That is likely where my interest in coding
                started.</p>
          
                <p> We moved to Atlanta to be closer to family for our daughters. In an
                  effort to have work/life balance, I started selling insurance including
                  life insurance. How about that for irony, I go from woring with explosives
                  to selling life insurance!</p>
          
                <p>Now I'm hoping to start my 3rd carreer...web developer. I can't wait!</p>
